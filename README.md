# FLAME Universe

FLAME is a lightweight and expressive generic head model learned from over 33,000 of accurately aligned 3D scans. FLAME combines a linear identity shape space (trained from head scans of 3800 subjects) with an articulated neck, jaw, and eyeballs, pose-dependent corrective blendshapes, and additional global expression blendshapes. For details please see the [scientific publication](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/uploads_file/attachment/attachment/400/paper.pdf).
